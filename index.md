My name is Zakaria, but I go by Zak. I've lived in San Diego almost all my life. 
Some of my hobbies include: 
- video games
- listening to music [My favorite song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)
- watching anime

When I was young my life goal was to impact the world in a positive way. 
Some of my inspirations for this goal were:
1. Bill Gates

2. Steve Jobs
3. Larry Page
These 3 and many others changed the world through technology, seeing that I decided that
if i wanted to do the same the best way would be through technology. So from a young age I was
adamant on becoming a programmer.
