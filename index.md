**About Me**

My name is Zakaria, but I go by Zak. I've lived in San Diego almost all my life. 
Some of my hobbies include: 
- video games
- listening to music ([My favorite song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ))
- watching anime

When I was young my life goal was to impact the world in a positive way. 
Some of my inspirations for this goal were:
1. Bill Gates

2. Steve Jobs

3. Larry Page

These 3 and many others changed the world through technology, seeing that, I decided that
if i wanted to do the same the best way would be through technology. So from a young age I was
adamant on becoming a programmer. A great quote by Larry Page that relates to this is:
> You never lose a dream. It just incubates as a hobby.

Like many others I started off my journey with a simple `Hello World` program.
Here are some goals I hope to achieve in the next 5 years, some sooner then others:
- [ ] graduate
- [ ] Begin my career
- [ ] Buy a Tesla
- [ ] Get married
